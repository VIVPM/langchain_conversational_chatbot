For implementation, RIG participants must be selected separately from the committee for each round since they need to be active for multiple slots (Tprepare + Tdistribute + Treconstruct) without obstructing blockchain growth. Each RIG execution spans an epoch of R rounds. With R=1000 rounds and 100 participants, RIG decreases transactions-per-second by less than 1%. The execution runs parallel to other Algorand operations, and components requiring random seeds can reuse previous seeds until new ones are synchronized.",

However, after the evaluation is done, verifying the\nresult is easy and much faster and anyone can do the verification using the verification\nkey vk.\nThe use-case of verifiable delay functions in random number generation is to again\ndefend against dishonest participants who do not reveal their choice in a commitment\nscheme. We can require every participant to provide a VDF whose evaluation is their\nchoice si. Then, even if the participant is dishonest and does not reveal their own choice,\nother participants can evaluate the VDF and obtain the si, hence ensuring availability\nfor our random number generation protocol. However, evaluation takes a long time, and\nhence the choice will not be revealed while in the commit phase.",

Finally, the RIG game requires an even number of participants, so if the number\nof valid participants is odd, we will remove one participant arbitrarily. To make sure\nthis does not have an effect on consensus, we can remove the participant for whom\nh(commit message) has the largest value.\nDesign of the Incentives. Every participant puts down a deposit d at the same time they\nsend their commit message. The value of d is fixed by the protocol. After collecting\nall the valid values si and ordering of the participants Pi, i ∈[1, n], the result has\nthe format (s, {Pi, ui}), where ui is the payoff of participant Pi. The values s, si are\nin {0, 1, . . . , m}, where m is a parameter of RIG game, i.e. the number of strategies\nfor each player. The output random number is computed as s = Pn\ni=1 si (mod m).\nNote that all dishonest players are excluded from the sum. If a player does not release",

With a slight misuse of notation, assume that pm+t =\npt for any integer t. If we subtract rs+1 by rs, we get\nps+f −ps = ps+m −ps+m−f = ps −ps−f\nLet q(s) = ps −ps−f, then q(s + f) = q(s). We also have q(s + m) = q(s). Since\ngcd(f, m) = 1, the function q(·) is constant on integers, from which we can infer that\np0 = p1 = · · · = pm−1 = 1/m. Therefore, ¯σ is still the only Nash equilibrium.\nImportant Remark on Parallelization. Note that the parallelization of RIG loses the\nuniqueness property of Nash equilibrium, hence we cannot simply have an RIG game\nfor m = 2, use it to generate a random bit, and parallelize it k times to generate k\nrandom bits. Instead, we must set m = 2k and have a single non-parallel RIG game. As\nan example, consider the simplified case of two players and k bits. If each player only"

PoW (Proof of Work) or fixed-validator \nconsensus protocols comprise most of the existing consensus \nmechanisms. However, the tremendous computational effort \nrequired for PoW leads to excessive energy and computing \nresource usage. On the other hand, Fixed-validator protocols \nvalidate new blocks by a fixed, static set of validators, allowing \nattackers to execute multiple attacks against these validators. In \nthis article, we proposed a novel consensus protocol base on the \nProof of Activity protocol and game theory.

        "question": "What role does VRF play in miner selection?",
        "ground_truth": "Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs) are widely used in proof-of-stake blockchain protocols for miner selection and randomness generation. A VRF produces an output that appears random but can be verified as correctly computed from a specific input and secret key. In protocols like Algorand and Ouroboros Praos, VRFs determine which participants are selected as miners for each slot or round. However, VRF-based randomness may not be uniformly distributed because the outputs depend on participants' secret keys and previous random seeds. Security analyses typically assume VRF outputs are uniform, but this assumption may not hold in practice, potentially affecting the fairness of miner selection.",

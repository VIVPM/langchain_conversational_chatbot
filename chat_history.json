However, the number of trainable parameters used in training is not explicitly stated as 671 billion. \n\nA related paper on arxiv.org mentions training a baseline MoE model with 228.7B total parameters, but this is not the DeepSeek-V3 model. The DeepSeek-V3 model's training details are mentioned in a report on wandb.ai, which states that the model was trained on a massive dataset of 14.8 trillion tokens, but it does not explicitly mention the number of trainable parameters.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it can be inferred that the total number of parameters in the DeepSeek-V3 model is 671 billion, but the exact number of trainable parameters used in training is not specified. \n\nKey sources: \n- https://wandb.ai/byyoung3/ml-news/reports/DeepSeek-V3-Training-671-billion-parameters-with-a-6-million-dollar-budget--VmlldzoxMDczNTI2Ng\n- https://arxiv.org/html/2412.19437v1\n- https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3\n\n**Web Sources used:**\n- https://wandb.ai/byyoung3/ml-news/reports/DeepSeek-V3-Training-671-billion-parameters-with-a-6-million-dollar-budget--VmlldzoxMDczNTI2Ng\n- https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/what-went-into-training-deepseek-r1\n- https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3\n- https://arxiv.org/html/2412.19437v1\n- https://www.bentoml.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-deepseek-models-from-v3-to-r1-and-beyond"}, {"role": "user", "content": "can u give me performance comparison made in two papers in table format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Answer (from web search):**\nAccording to various sources, including [Academia Stack Exchange](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/120595/comparison-of-methods-in-a-paper-with-a-table) and [Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-compare-between-2-research-journal-papers), comparing two research papers can be done by exploring similarities and differences between them, and presenting the comparison in a table format.\n\nTo create a comparison table, you can use tools like [Canva's comparison chart maker](https://www.canva.com/graphs/comparison-charts/), which allows you to compare two or more options across different parameters.\n\nHere is a general outline of how you can create a performance comparison table:\n\n| Parameter | Paper 1 | Paper 2 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Methodology |  |  |\n| Results |  |  |\n| Advantages |  |  |\n| Disadvantages |  |  |\n\nYou can fill in the table with the relevant information from the two papers, and use it to visualize the comparison between them.\n\nNote: The specific columns and parameters will depend on the content of the papers and the focus of the comparison.\n\n**Web Sources used:**\n- https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/120595/comparison-of-methods-in-a-paper-with-a-table\n- https://www.nngroup.com/articles/comparison-tables/\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23676863/comparing-data-in-two-tables-taking-time\n- https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-compare-between-2-research-journal-papers\n- https://www.canva.com/graphs/comparison-charts/"}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is ABC"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Answer:**\nABC stands for Artificial Bee Colony.\n\n**Sources used:**\n- Overview_of_Artificial_Bee_Colony_ABC_algorithm_and_its_applications.pdf"}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is meaning of abc"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Answer (from memory):**\nABC stands for Artificial Bee Colony."}, {"role": "user", "content": "explain abc?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Answer (from memory):**\nABC stands for Artificial Bee Colony."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Explain ABC in 100 words?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Answer (from memory):**\nABC stands for Artificial Bee Colony.
